title: The Mirah Programming Language
---

<p>
  Mirah is a new way of looking at JVM languages. In attempting to build a replacement for Java, we have followed a few guiding principals:
</p>

<h3>No runtime library</h3>
<p>
Mirah does not impose any jar files upon you. YOU decide what your application’s dependencies should be.
</p>

<h3>Clean, simple syntax</h3>
<p>
We have borrowed heavily from Ruby, but added static typing and minor syntax changes to support the JVM’s type system. The result is pleasing to the eye, but as powerful as Java.
</p>
<h3>Metaprogramming and macros</h3>
<p>
Mirah supports various mechanisms for compile-time metaprogramming and macros. Much of the “open class” feel of dynamic languages is possible in Mirah.
</p>

<h3>No performance penalty</h3>
<p>
Because Mirah directly targets the JVM’s type system and JVM bytecode,
it performs exactly as well as Java.
